Thank you for downloading the "Desktop Rabite" ghost! This little critter is from the Mana/Seiken Densetsu series and was made for the Ukagaka Dream Team's 2022 ghost jam, which is a challenge to build a ghost within a week.

This ghost is currently in its "bare bones" stages and functions mostly as an idle pet but when completed, it will be a self-care buddy/pet. Planned updates will include;
	More dialogue poses, animations, etc
	More dialogue prompts focused around self-care reminders
	An eventual money-earning system that will allow you to buy toys and special foods for your Rabite
	An affection system that can be affected by how well you're taking care of yourself and/or your rabite
	File cleanups, etc

Art, writing, and coding done by CrabbyMaiden with the help of Zarla's GT template.
